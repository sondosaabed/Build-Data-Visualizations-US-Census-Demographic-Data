## US Census Demographic Data: Story visualization 

This report details the process and outcomes of Project 1 for the Data Visualization with Tableau Nanodegree. Using a dataset of US Census demographics, this project explores key demographic trends across the country. 

Dashboard: Economic Performance in a Diverse America
The final dashboard integrates the scatter plot, map, and ranked list to provide a comprehensive answer to the relationship between diversity and socioeconomic health. The dashboard layout follows a "Macro-to-Micro" flow: the title sets the theme, the map provides the geographic "Where," the scatter plot explains the "Why" (correlation), and the ranked list provides the "Who" (specific leading states). 


### Dashboard: Economic Performance in a diverse America 
A filter of state was applied to only two sheets, the map and the scatter, given that the list filter, a top 5 filter was applied in a fixed way to only show the top 5 median income. A border was applied, with different background colors to each sheet and to the filter, legends. The choice to use a monochromatic blue scale for diversity across all sheets ensures that the user does not have to relearn the "meaning" of colors as they move between visualizations.

### Conclusion
This project utilized US Census data to explore the complex intersections of geography, industry, and demography in relation to economic success. Through the systematic application of Tableau’s visualization capabilities, several key conclusions have been reached:
•	Transportation as a Metric of Well-being: While the District of Columbia leads in infrastructure utility (37.4% transit usage), Alaska offers a superior quality of life in terms of time, with a commute of only 11.23 minutes. This highlights that "best" transportation is context-dependent, balancing infrastructure density with time efficiency.
•	Decoupling Construction and Poverty: The analysis debunked the assumption that construction employment significantly mitigates poverty at the county level. The flat trend line in the scatter plot suggests that economic resilience requires a more diversified industrial base than construction alone.
•	The Inland Economic Strength: Contrary to the "coastal advantage" hypothesis, Inland counties maintained a marginally higher median income ($45,541) than coastal ones ($43,146). This underscores the economic importance of specialized inland hubs and suggests that being "landlocked" is not a barrier to socioeconomic health.
•	Diversity as an Economic Asset: The core finding of this report is the weakly positive correlation between a state’s diversity and its median income. The presence of high-diversity states like Maryland and DC at the top of the income rankings indicates that multiculturalism and economic prosperity are strongly compatible in the modern American economy.
